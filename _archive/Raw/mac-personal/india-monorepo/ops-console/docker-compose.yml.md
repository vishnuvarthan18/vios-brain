# Ops console — private admin web app.
#
# Joins the existing core-infra network rather than standing up its own
# Postgres: it reads the same database the engines write to. The published
# port binds to 127.0.0.1 for the same reason core-infra's do (DECISIONS.md
# D-2: Docker's iptables rules are evaluated before ufw's INPUT chain, so a
# 0.0.0.0 bind is internet-reachable even with ufw denying everything).
# Reach it from the Mac over an SSH tunnel:
#   ssh -L 8010:127.0.0.1:8010 ubuntu@40.160.137.239
